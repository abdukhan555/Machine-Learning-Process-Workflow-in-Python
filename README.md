Basic Walk-Through: k-nearest Neighbors This notebook contains several examples that illustrate the machine learning workflow using a dataset of house prices.  We will use the fairly straightforward k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm that allows us to tackle both regression and classification problems.
